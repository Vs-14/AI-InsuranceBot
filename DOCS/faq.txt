FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

GENERAL INSURANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: What factors affect my insurance premium?
A: Premiums are determined by several factors including age, coverage amount, health condition (for health/life insurance), driving record (for auto insurance), property value and location (for home insurance), and claim history.

Q: Can I cancel my policy at any time?
A: Yes, most policies can be canceled at any time. However, some may charge a cancellation fee or only provide a partial refund based on a short-rate table. Term life insurance typically has no refund value upon cancellation.

Q: How do I file a claim?
A: Claims can be filed through our website, mobile app, or by calling our claims hotline at 1-800-555-CLAIM. The specific documentation required varies by policy type and claim nature.

Q: What is a deductible?
A: A deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance coverage begins. For example, with a $500 deductible, you'd pay the first $500 of a covered claim, and insurance would cover the rest up to your policy limits.

HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: What is the difference between in-network and out-of-network care?
A: In-network providers have contracted rates with your insurance company, resulting in lower out-of-pocket costs. Out-of-network providers haven't negotiated rates, potentially resulting in higher costs and lower coverage percentages.

Q: Does my health insurance cover prescription medications?
A: Most health plans include prescription drug coverage, but the specifics vary. Medications are typically organized in tiers, with different copay or coinsurance amounts for each tier.

LIFE INSURANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?
A: Term life provides coverage for a specific period (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years) with no cash value component. Whole life provides lifetime coverage and includes a cash value component that grows over time.

Q: Do I need a medical exam to get life insurance?
A: Many policies require a medical exam, but we also offer no-exam policies with simplified underwriting for coverage up to $500,000. No-exam policies typically have higher premiums.

AUTO INSURANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: Does my auto insurance cover rental cars?
A: If you have comprehensive and collision coverage on your policy, it typically extends to rental cars within the U.S. and Canada. However, you may want to consider supplemental liability protection from the rental company.

Q: Will my premium increase after an accident?
A: Not necessarily. If you have accident forgiveness and it's your first accident, your rates won't increase. Otherwise, at-fault accidents typically increase premiums for 3-5 years.

HOME INSURANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: Does home insurance cover flood damage?
A: Standard home insurance policies do not cover flood damage. Separate flood insurance must be purchased, typically through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private insurers.

Q: How is home insurance replacement cost determined?
A: Replacement cost is calculated based on local construction costs per square foot, your home's features, materials, and special characteristics. It's not related to market value or purchase price.
